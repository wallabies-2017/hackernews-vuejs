Hacker News Clone
===================

This challenge is to create your own [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) from scratch. Install Windows and get Dreamweaver fired up, we're on a time travel trip back to 1999! 

Just kidding. Using modern conventions and technologies, ours will be better than the real thing - other than the users and content and respected name of course.

How you want do this is mostly up to you for this challenge.

### Models

Go through Hacker News thoroughly and get the flow.

We need atleast these models from Hacker News that need to built out and displayed:

    Posts
    Comments
    **Bonus** Nested Comments

### Guidelines

Go through Hacker News thoroughly and get the flow.

Work on your CSS skills - make your site as visually close to Hacker News as possible.

## Use webpack-simple to compile your Single File Components

> A simple Vue 2.0 Webpack & `vue-loader` setup for quick prototyping. Note this template is not suitable for production - for that you may want to wait for an official 2.0 webpack template.

> This template is Vue 2.0 compatible. For Vue 1.x use this command: `vue init webpack-simple#1.0 my-project`

### Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init webpack-simple my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

### What's Included

- `npm run dev`: Webpack + `vue-loader` with proper config for source maps & hot-reload.

- `npm run build`: build with HTML/CSS/JS minification.

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader). Also check out the [breaking changes in vue-loader@9.0.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/releases/tag/v9.0.0).

### Fork It And Make Your Own

You can fork this repo to create your own boilerplate, and use it with `vue-cli`:

``` bash
vue init username/repo my-project
```
